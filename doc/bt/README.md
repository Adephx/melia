Binary Templates
=============================================================================

What is this?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains research about packet structures in form of binary
templates, for use with 010 Editor. The templates represent the packet's
structures at the point in time indicated by the version in the
template's header.

Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the version is "i171140", the template was added and confirmed to
be correct at revision 171140 of iToS. If the version is older than the
current client's revision, it doesn't necessarily mean that the template
is outdated, as they aren't checked all on every update, but it's possible.

History
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The history in the template's headers documents all changes that
were made to a packet's structure, starting from when the template
was first created. Changes that occurred before it was created will
usually not be documented.
