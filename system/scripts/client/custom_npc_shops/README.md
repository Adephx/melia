Custom NPC Shops
=============================================================================

The NPC shop item lists are stored in the client, and there's no simple
way to customize them from the server. That means, to create custom shops,
we'd need to modify the client. These client scripts modify the shop
scripts, so that the server can take control over the displayed items.
